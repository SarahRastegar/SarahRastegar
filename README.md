**Hi there** 👋, I’m Sarah, a PhD student in the **Video Image Sense lab ([VISlab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/))** at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Cees Snoek](https://www.ceessnoek.info/). My research primarily focuses on **open-world recognition**, but I’m also deeply interested in **video understanding**, **causal inference**, and **foundation models**. Beyond research, I love **collecting** and **surveying information** on various topics.

### 📑 Collections
- 🔍 **[Open World Recognition Papers](https://github.com/SarahRastegar/Open-World-Papers)** This repo contains **1,000+ papers** from top-tier conferences and journals, exploring open-world recognition and related areas like novel class discovery, zero-shot learning, anomaly and out-of-distribution detection.
- 🏅 **[Best Papers from Top Venues](https://github.com/SarahRastegar/Best-Papers-Top-Venues)** I’ve always wondered what high-quality papers have in common. To investigate, I’ve curated a list of best papers and honorable mentions from recent top CV and ML conferences.
### 🔬 Research
- 📄 **SelEx** (*[SelEx: Self-Expertise in Fine-Grained Generalized Category Discovery - ECCV 2024](https://github.com/SarahRastegar/SelEx)*)  
We propose **self-expertise** as an alternative to self-supervision for fine-grained generalized category discovery.
- 📄 **InfoSieve** (*[Learn to Categorize or Categorize to Learn? Self-Coding for Generalized Category Discovery - NeurIPS 2023](https://github.com/SarahRastegar/InfoSieve)*)  
In this work, we define a new mathematical formulation of **category** as a solution to an optimization problem, where the model finds the shortest sequence of 0s and 1s to categorize a sample.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out or explore my repositories.
